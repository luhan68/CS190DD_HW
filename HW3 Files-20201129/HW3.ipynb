First, a nice data structure called Tensor (basically a matrix, similar to Numpy ndarray). Tensor is optimized for matrix calculation and can be loaded to a GPU. Tensor is also implemented so that it's easy to calculate and pass back chains of gradients, which is extremely useful for backpropagation on neural network. Second, a nice inner mechanism called Autograd that nicely map variables involved a chain of calculations and efficiently calculate their gradients via the chain rule when needed.

It automatically uses grid search to determine which weight should be given to `SEX==1` datapoints vs `SEX==2` datapoints (if you're interested you can read the source code).
