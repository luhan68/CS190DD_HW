First, a nice data structure called Tensor (basically a matrix, similar to Numpy ndarray). Tensor is optimized for matrix calculation and can be loaded to a GPU. Tensor is also implemented so that it's easy to calculate and pass back chains of gradients, which is extremely useful for backpropagation on neural network. Second, a nice inner mechanism called Autograd that nicely map variables involved a chain of calculations and efficiently calculate their gradients via the chain rule when needed.

The dataset has 7 features and 3 labels. Refer to the example from the discussion session if needed. \n","\n","**In this problem, you are given a good amount of freedom in tweaking your choices in designing the network. As long as it's still a feed-forward network, it's fine. Accuracy does not matter as long as it's reasonable (like above 80%) but do try to achieve a high accuracy.**\n","\n","(Optional): the dataset provided to you is very simple. Instead, you can challenge yourself by trying more difficult datasets.
